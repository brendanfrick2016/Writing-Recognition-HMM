Best Classifier Process:
	
	To build our best classifier, we tried using curvature and drawing velocity.
	We tried each method separately (with moderate success), before combining
	them to achieve our most succesful classifier.
	
	Curvature was continuous. Velocity was discrete. Velocity threshold was
	determined by looking at the data for a natural split. From there we did 
	multiple iterations of training while increasing/decreasing the threshold 
	to optimize the split (i.e. we found the threshold that has a high 
	'text' probability for less than and a low 'drawing' probability for less
	than (and vice-versa). Our solution was not optimized but on small datasets
	it will be equally accurate (within .1 of local optimal settings).

	It is more succesful than our basic method. Although the performance is 
	numerically worse, it is proven to be less likely to pick one state 
	repeatedly, which happens often because of high transition probabilities.
	Since the emission function is included to evaluate probabilities based
	solely on features, we considered a more dynamic classifier as more 
	successful emission function. Also, the results we included were relatively 
	similar (within two instances). With more training data, the best method 
	performed better because it resisted classifying all instances as one state.
